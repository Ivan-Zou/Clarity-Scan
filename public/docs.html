        <h2>About Clarity Scan</h2>
        <p>Clarity Scan is a Chrome Extension designed to analyze YouTube content 
           and detect "Brain Rot" content by processing video transcripts.</p>

        <h2>What is Brain-Rot?</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>A brain-rot YouTube video is one that prioritizes <strong>sensationalism, misinformation, 
            or mindless entertainment</strong> over substance, critical thinking, or meaningful value.</p>
            <p>Clarity Scan helps detect such content, allowing users to make informed decisions about the media they consume.</p>

        <h2>Brain-Rot Scoring System</h2>
        <p>Clarity Scan assigns a Brain-Rot Score ranging from <strong>0% to 100%</strong>, in increments of <strong>10%</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0%:</strong> No brain-rot is present. The videos are purely academic or educational in nature with high-quality and informative content.</li>
            <li><strong>10%:</strong> Educational videos that are more casual and include more personality. These may include personal anecdotes or small jokes.</li>
            <li><strong>20%:</strong> More casual educational videos where the presence of humor may begin to make the video less straightforward.</li>
            <li><strong>30%:</strong> Casual videos that are on topic, but frequent tangents, skits, or stories interrupt the flow.</li>
            <li><strong>40%:</strong> Videos that begin to use slightly exaggerated content, memes, or jokes, which alienate viewers looking for serious content.</li>
            <li><strong>50%:</strong> Videos where memes or jokes are still creative, funny, or charming, but detract from the main focus of the video.</li>
            <li><strong>60%:</strong> Videos where humorous or silly content clashes with and threatens to overtake more serious topics in the video.</li>
            <li><strong>70%:</strong> Videos that contain more exaggerated elements than actual substance, distracting from the main topic of the video.</li>
            <li><strong>80%:</strong> Videos that make overly emotional, dramatic, and hyperbolic claims about topics.</li>
            <li><strong>90%:</strong> Videos that make ludicrous and baseless claims about topics.</li>
            <li><strong>100%:</strong> Videos which are completely unintelligible, misinformed, and wrong.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The score is calculated using AI-driven content analysis alongside our custom Python model.</p>

        <h2>How We Grade Brain-Rot</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>We use a multi-step process to analyze YouTube video content:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We first detect and retrieve the transcript from the current YouTube video.</li>
                <li>We define brain-rot as: <strong>“A brain-rot YouTube video is one that prioritizes sensationalism, misinformation, or mindless entertainment over substance, critical thinking, or meaningful value.”</strong></li>
                <li>We then prompt ChatGPT to generate a short brain-rot review based on the transcript.</li>
                <li>To assign a score consistent with our scoring system, we feed this review into our custom Python model.</li>
                <li>Our model is trained on a combination of ~1000 real and synthetically generated YouTube video reviews that have been manually labeled.</li>
                <li>It uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to extract features from the review based on word frequencies.</li>
                <li>These features are fed into a 3-layer neural network, which assigns a final brain-rot score.</li>
                <li>Finally, we send back the score to the user along with the ChatGPT-generated review, providing further clarification.</li>
            </ol>
