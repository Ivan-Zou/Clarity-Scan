        <h2>About Clarity Scan</h2>
        <p>Clarity Scan is a Chrome Extension designed to analyze YouTube content 
           and detect "Brain Rot" content by processing video transcripts.</p>

        <h2>What is Brain-Rot?</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>A brain-rot YouTube video is one that prioritizes <strong>sensationalism, misinformation, 
            or mindless entertainment</strong> over substance, critical thinking, or meaningful value.</p>
            <p>Clarity Scan helps detect such content, allowing users to make informed decisions about the media they consume.</p>

        <h2>Brain-Rot Scoring System</h2>
        <p>Clarity Scan assigns a Brain-Rot Score ranging from <strong>0% to 90%</strong>, in increments of <strong>10%</strong>. Here is some of the criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0%:</strong> Basically no brain-rot is present. Videos tend to be well researched, academic in nature, and teach you something about the world. Oftentimes, these are high-budget documentary style videos you may expect to find on paid services.</li>
            <li><strong>50%:</strong> Medium levels of brain-rot are present. Non-educational videos that are not over the top tend to fall here, as well as educational videos presented in overly humorous ways.</li>
            <li><strong>90%:</strong> High levels of brain-rot are present. These tend to be high energy, disjointed, clickbait-type videos that serve only entertainment purposes and teach little to nothing about the world. They tend to have aggresive titles and thumbnails and serve no educational purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The score is calculated using AI-driven content analysis alongside our custom Python model.</p>

        <h2>How We Grade Brain-Rot</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>We use a multi-step process to analyze YouTube video content:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We first detect and retrieve the transcript from the current YouTube video.</li>
                <li>We define brain-rot as: <strong>“A brain-rot YouTube video is one that prioritizes sensationalism, misinformation, or mindless entertainment over substance, critical thinking, or meaningful value.”</strong></li>
                <li>We then prompt ChatGPT to generate a short brain-rot review based on the transcript.</li>
                <li>To assign a score consistent with our scoring system, we feed this review into our custom Python model.</li>
                <li>Our model is trained on a combination of ~1000 real and synthetically generated YouTube video reviews that have been manually labeled.</li>
                <li>We use a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 text to text transformer to generate the brain rot score. </li>
                <li>Finally, we send back the score to the user along with the ChatGPT-generated review, providing further clarification.</li>
            </ol>
